#### 1. R INTRODUCTION ####


### R 1.1 R Overview

# R is a dialect of S. S was created in the Bell Labs by John Chambers and his team as an object oriented language to do data analysis, statistical modeling, simulation and graphics. 

# R is a dialect of S. In other words, R is an improved version of R with very flexible and powerful capabilities to model problems and analyze data. R is different than S, but it was conceptualized as an improvement to S, so most S code will run fine in R.

# The name R comes from their two creators Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman (what a great name) from the University of Auckland, New Zealand.

# To get started with R, you can use this documentation from CRAN

# You can install R by downloading it from a "mirror" site. The R installation files are posted in several similar sites. You can pick any mirror site, but it is recommended to pick one that is in close proximity to your location. In my experience, it is best to pick a mirror site that is more reliable. The best mirror site in the USA (Berkeley) seems to work well.

### R 1.2 R Packages

# The power of R rests on the thousands of packages already written for R, which are publicly available at CRAN. We discuss how to install packages and load their respective libraries a bit later. To view all R packages, see:

### R 1.3 R Studio Overview

# Studio provides 4 different windows:

# 1. Top-Left: Script window -- this is where you 
#    write scripts

# 2. Bottom-Left: R Console -- this is where you can type R 
#    commands directly and where R displays results and 
#    messages when you run commands. If you were not using 
#    R Studio, you would only see this R Console.

# 3. Top-Right: Environment window -- this is where you can 
#    see any R objects created or opened (e.g., variables, 
#    data tables, etc.)

# 4. Bottom-Right: Model explorer -- this is where you can 
#    view the files in the working directory, plots generated 
#    by R commands, packages available and installed, help 
#   displays, etc.
