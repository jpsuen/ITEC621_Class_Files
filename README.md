# ITEC621 Class Files

### Intro
I often find that GitHub is an easier place to find everything quickly so this repository was set up to contain everything important to the ITEC 621 - Predictive Analytics class at American University.  

### Overview
I created this repo to handle a few tasks:
  1. Organizing the 5611 lines of code from the 'ITEC 621 R Scripts.R' file into individual files specific to each lesson plan
    - I realize that sometimes line numbers from the original document are mentioned in the lectures so use at your own risk.  
  2. Creating a quick script to replace the 'ITEC 621 R Packages.R' file for the following reasons
    - The original file cannot be quickly re-run to load all the required packages.
    - The original script attempts to re-install the packages if you select the whole thing to run
  3. 2KSB makes it difficult to quickly view files that I just want to browse or double check something.  I added a MISC folder to accomodate these types of files
