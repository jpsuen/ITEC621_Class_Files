# ITEC621 Class Files

### Overview
This class is a bit overwhelming and clearly needs a lot of work...  Luckily the people at Stanford who developed the text book (ISLR) have done a lot of work and have provided a lot of videos and slides.  This GitHub acts as a place where I have merged this data together to provide supplemental information to the ITEC 621 course.  

Throughout this project I have included all of the ITEC621 Lecture slides and knowledge checks.  These are all paired with ISLR videos/slides from the great guys at Stanford.  In the Misc folder there is a ton of great additional tips to help get you through everything.
