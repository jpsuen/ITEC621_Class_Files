# ITEC621 Class Files

### Overview
This class is a bit overwhelming and for many students means learning R and advanced statistics simultaneously.  Luckily the people at Stanford who developed the text book (ISLR) have done a lecture series that complement the AU ITEC 621 class with a range of supplementary videos and slides.  This GitHub is a merging of the ITEC 621 & Stanford source materials to provide students with additional resources to help guide you through the course.

Throughout this project I have included all of the ITEC 621 Lecture slides and knowledge checks.  Each folder in this repo contains 1 week of course material with the appropriate ITEC 621 and Stanford materials.  In the Misc folder there are a ton of great additional resources/tips to help get you through everything.
